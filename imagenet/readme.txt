Okay.

ImageNet processor works.  Identifies.

Need to find a way to hook it up to download google image search based on keyword.



googleimagesdownload -k cat -l 1

with cat as keyword

then run open to display it

Googleimagesdownload can use a file for keywords.  Edit tensor flow program, classify_image.py to create the file.

Use 

imagesnap -w 1

to grab image from camera, snapshot.jpg
